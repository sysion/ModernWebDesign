		<h2>Anatomy</h2>
		<h3>Skeleton</h3>
		<div>
			<div>
				<p>
					All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have an identical <em>skeletal</em> structure with the exception of the number of bones in the tail, although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different types. The dog's skeleton is well adapted for running; the <em>vertebrae</em> on the neck and back have extensions for powerful back muscles to connect to, the long ribs provide plenty of room for the heart and lungs, and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton allowing great flexibility.
				</p>

				<p>
					Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication has seen the dog's skeleton greatly enhanced in size for larger types as <em>mastiffs</em> and miniaturised for smaller types such as <i>terriers; dwarfism</i> has been selectively utilised for some types where short legs are advantageous such as <i>dachshunds</i> and <i>corgis</i>. Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally short tails have as few as three.
				</p>

				<p>
					The dog's skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but there is significant divergence in terms of skull shape between types. The three basic skull shapes are the elongated dolichocephalic type as seen in <em>sighthounds</em>, the intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and the very short and broad brachycephalic type exemplified by mastiff type skulls.

		<h3>Senses</h3>
		<p>
			A dog's senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and sensitivity to Earth's magnetic field. Another study has suggested that dogs can see Earth's magnetic field.[31]
		</p>

		<h3>Coat</h3>
		<p>
			The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or "single", with the topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or underside.[32] Premature graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, fear of noise, and fear of unfamiliar people or animals.[33]
		</p>
		
		<h3>Tail</h3>
		<p>
			There are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or corkscrew. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be crucial in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Health</h3>
		<p>
			Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. Two severe medical conditions significantly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all breeds and ages, and Gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms, which is a roundworm species that lives in the hearts of dogs.
		</p>

		<p>
			Several human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids, causing theobromine poisoning, onions and garlic, causing thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning, grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, and xylitol.[34] The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous to dogs. Signs of ingestion can include copious vomiting (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other symptoms are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death.[35][page needed]
		</p>

		<p>
			Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.
		</p>

		<h3>Lifespan</h3>
		<p>
			The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most, the median longevity (the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive) ranges from 10 to 13 years[36][37] with the longest lifespan of a dog being 22 years[38] and a report of a dog living 29 years.[citation needed] The median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged.[36][37][39] For dogs in England, increased body weight has been found to be negatively correlated with longevity (i.e., the heavier the dog, the shorter its lifespan), and mixed-breed dogs live on average 1.2 years longer than purebred dogs.[40]
		</p>

		<h3>Reproduction</h3>
		<p>
			In domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six months to one year for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age for some large breeds, and is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, females will become estrous, mentally and physically receptive to copulation. Because the ova survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation, more than one male can sire the same litter.[12]
		</p>

		<p>
			Fertilization typically occurs two to five days after ovulation; 14â€“16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus and after seven to eight more days, a heartbeat is detectable.[41][42]
		</p>

		<p>
			Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization,[12][43] with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six puppies.[44]
		</p>

		<h3>Neutering</h3>
		<p>
			Neutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removing the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of dogs' overpopulation in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may later be euthanized.[45]
		</p>

		<p>
			According to the Humane Society of the United States, three to four million dogs and cats are euthanized each year.[46] Many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.[47]
		</p>

		<p>
			Neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs.[48] Spayed female dogs are less likely to develop cancers affecting the mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs.[49][page needed] However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs[50] and prostate cancer in males[51] and osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex.[52]
		</p>

		<h3>Inbreeding depression</h3>
		<p>
			A common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close relatives (e.g., between half and full siblings).[53] Inbreeding depression is considered to be due mainly to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations.[54] Outcrossing between unrelated individuals, including dogs of different breeds, results in the beneficial masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny.[55]
		</p>

		<p>
			In a study of seven dog breeds (the Bernese Mountain Dog, Basset Hound, Cairn Terrier, Brittany, German Shepherd Dog, Leonberger, and West Highland White Terrier), it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival.[56] Another analysis of data on 42,855 Dachshund litters found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression.[57] In a study of Boxer litters, 22% of puppies died before reaching 7 weeks of age. Stillbirth was the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection. Mortality due to infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding.[58]
