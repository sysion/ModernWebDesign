			<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
			<p>
				In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist <strong>Carl Linnaeus</strong> published in his <strong>Systema Naturae</strong>, the two-word naming of species (<em>binomial nomenclature</em>). <i>Canis</i> is the <em>Latin</em> word meaning "dog", and under this <em>genus</em>, he listed the domestic dog, the <em>wolf</em>, and the <em>golden jackal</em>. He classified the domestic dog as <i>Canis familiaris</i> and, on the next page, classified the grey wolf as <i>Canis lupus</i>. Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata), which is not found in any other <i>canid</i>.
			</p>

			<p>
				In 1999, a study of <i>mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)</i> indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from the grey wolf, with the <em>dingo</em> and <em>New Guinea singing dog</em> breeds having developed at a time when human communities were more isolated from each other. In the third edition of <em>Mammal Species of the World</em> published in 2005, the <i>mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft</i> listed under the wolf <i>Canis lupus</i> its wild subspecies and proposed two additional subspecies, which formed the domestic dog clade: <i>familiaris</i>, as named by Linnaeus in 1758 and, dingo named by Meyer in 1793. Wozencraft included <i>hallstromi</i> (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (<i>junior synonym</i>) for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mtDNA study as one of the guides informing his decision. Mammalogists have noted the inclusion of <i>familiaris</i> and <i>dingo</i> together under the "domestic dog" clade with some debating it.
			</p>

			<p>
				In 2019, a workshop hosted by the <em>IUCN</em>/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog to be <em>feral</em> <i>Canis familiaris</i> and therefore did not assess them for the <em>IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</em>.

		<section class='evolution'>
			<h2>Evolution</h2>
			<p>
				The <em>Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event</em> occurred 65 million years ago and brought an end to the non-avian <i>dinosaurs</i> and the appearance of the first carnivorans. The name <i>carnivoran</i> is given to a member of the order Carnivora. Carnivorans possess a common arrangement of teeth called <em>carnassials</em>, in which the first lower <em>molar</em> and the last upper <em>premolar</em> possess blade-like enamel <em>crowns</em> that act similar to a pair of shears for cutting meat. This dental arrangement has been modified by adaptation over the past 60 million years for diets composed of meat, for crushing vegetation, or for the loss of the carnassial function altogether as in seals, sea lions, and walruses. Today, not all <em>carnivorans</em> are carnivores, such as the insect-eating <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardwolf'>Aardwolf</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The carnivoran ancestors of the dog-like <i>caniforms</i> and the cat-like <i>feliforms</i> began their separate evolutionary paths just after the end of the dinosaurs. The first members of the dog family <em>Canidae</em> appeared 40 million years ago, of which only its subfamily the <em>Caninae</em> survives today in the form of the wolf-like and fox-like canines. Within the Caninae, the first members of genus <i>Canis</i> appeared six million years ago, the ancestors of modern domestic dogs, wolves, <em>coyotes</em>, and golden jackals.

			<h3>Domestication</h3>
			<p>
				The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in <strong>Bonn-Oberkassel</strong>, Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf. The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of <em>canine distemper</em>. Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have been described as <em>Paleolithic dogs</em>, but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the <em>Late Pleistocene</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated in the time of <i>hunter–gatherers</i>, which predates agriculture. <em>DNA sequences</em> show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population which was distinct from the <em>modern wolf</em> lineage. Most dogs form a sister group to the remains of a Late <em>Pleistocene wolf</em> found in the <i>Kessleroch cave</i> near <em>Thayngen</em> in the canton of <em>Schaffhausen, Switzerland</em>, which dates to 14,500 years ago. The <i>most recent common ancestor</i> of both is estimated to be from 32,100 years ago. This indicates that an extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog, with the modern wolf being the dog's nearest living relative.
			</p>

			<p>
				The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely travelled a <em>commensal</em> pathway into domestication. The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed geneticists and archaeologists for decades. Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 years ago, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia. In 2021, a <i>literature review</i> of the current evidence <i>infers</i> that the dog was domesticated in <strong>Siberia</strong> 23,000 years ago by <em>ancient North Siberians</em>, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia.

			<h3>Breeds</h3>
			<p>
				Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized <em>dog breeds</em>. In the <em>Victorian era</em>, directed human <i>selection</i> developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes. Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years, and since then dogs have undergone rapid <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype'>phenotypic</a> change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to <i>artificial selection</i> imposed by humans. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour. Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, and hunting, retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. As a result, present day dogs are the most abundant carnivore species and are dispersed around the world. The most striking example of this dispersal is that of the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during the <em>Victorian era</em>.
