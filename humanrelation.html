		<h2>Roles with humans</h2>
		<p>
			Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as <em>bite inhibition</em>, from their wolf ancestors, which would have been <em>pack hunters</em> with a complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness and ability to fit into human households and social situations. These attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful animals today.
		</p>

		<p>
			The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as <em>hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police</em> and the <em>military, companionship</em> and <em>aiding disabled individuals</em>. This influence on human society has given them the nickname <em>"man's best friend"</em> in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are <a href='#As_food'>also a source of meat</a>.

			<h3>Pets</h3>
			<p>
				It is estimated that three-quarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs, with pet dogs uncommon.
			</p>

			<p>
				"The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs" and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history. Pet dog populations grew significantly after <em>World War II</em> as suburbanization increased. In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today(the expression "in the doghouse" - recorded since 1932 - to describe exclusion from the group implies a distance between the <em>doghouse</em> and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the pet dog's role, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians. People and their dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other's lives to the point where pet dogs actively shape how a family and home are experienced.
			</p>

			<p>
				There have been two significant trends occurring within the second half of the 20th century in pet dogs' changing status. The first has been <em>"commodification"</em>, shaping it to conform to social expectations of personality and behavior. The second has been the broadening of the family's concept and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.
			</p>

			<p>
				A vast range of commodity forms aims to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion. The list of goods, services, and places available is enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing to dog groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, spas, parks and beaches and dog hotels, airlines and cemeteries. Dog training books, classes, and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued.
			</p>

			<p>
				The majority of contemporary dog owners describe their pet as part of the family, although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog-human family as a pack. Some dog trainers, such as on the television program <em>Dog Whisperer</em>, have promoted a <em>dominance model</em> of dog-human relationships. However, it has been disputed that "trying to achieve status" is characteristic of dog-human interactions. The idea of the <em>"alpha dog"</em> trying to be dominant is based on a disproved theory about wolf packs. Pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of conversations in dog-human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog; to mediate their interactions with each other.
			</p>

			<p>
				Increasingly, human family-members engage in activities centered on the dog's perceived needs and interests, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as <em>dog dancing</em> and <em>dog yoga</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				According to statistics published by the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pet_Products_Manufacturers_Association'>American Pet Products Manufacturers Association</a> in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009–2010, an estimated 77.5 million people in the United States have pet dogs. The same source shows that nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not seem to be any <em>gender preference</em> among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of male and female pet dogs. Although several programs promote <em>pet adoption</em>, less than one-fifth of the owned dogs come from shelters.
			</p>

			<p>
				A study using <em>magnetic resonance imaging</em> (MRI) to compare humans and dogs showed that dogs have the same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans do. This gives dogs the ability to recognize human emotional sounds, making them friendly social pets to humans.

			<h3>Workers</h3>
			<p>
				Dogs have lived and worked with humans in many roles. In addition to dogs' role as companion animals, dogs have been bred for herding livestock (<em>collies, sheepdogs</em>), hunting (hounds, pointers) and rodent control (terriers). Other types of <em>working dogs</em> include <em>search and rescue dogs, detection dogs</em> trained to detect <em>illicit drugs</em> or <em>chemical weapons</em>; guard dogs; dogs who assist fishermen with the use of nets; and dogs that pull loads. In 1957, the dog <strong><em>Laika</em></strong> became the first animal to be launched into <em>Earth orbit</em>, aboard the <em>Soviets' Sputnik 2</em>; she died during the flight.
			</p>

			<p>
				Various kinds of <em>service dogs</em> and <em>assistance dogs</em>, including <em>guide dogs, hearing dogs, mobility assistance dogs</em> and <em>psychiatric service dogs</em>, assist individuals with disabilities. Some dogs owned by people with epilepsy have been shown to alert their handler when the handler shows signs of an impending seizure, sometimes well in advance of onset, allowing the guardian to seek safety, medication, or medical care.

			<h3>Athletes and models</h3>
			<p>
				People often enter their dogs in competitions, such as breed-conformation shows or <em>sports</em>, including racing, sledding and agility competitions. In conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard. As the breed standard only deals with the dog's externally observable qualities (such as appearance, movement and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows.

			<h3>Food</h3>
			<p>
				Dog meat is consumed in some <em>East Asian</em> countries, including <em>Korea, China, Vietnam</em> and the <em>Philippines</em>, which dates back to antiquity. Based on limited data, it is estimated that 13–16 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year. In China, debates have ensued over banning the consumption of dog meat. Following the Sui and Tang dynasties of the first millennium, however, people living on northern China's plains began to eschew eating dogs, which is likely due to Buddhism and Islam's spread, two religions that forbade the consumption of certain animals, including the dog. As members of the upper classes shunned dog meat, it gradually became a social taboo to eat it, even though the general population continued to consume it for centuries afterward.[citation needed] Dog meat is also consumed in some parts of Switzerland. Other cultures, such as <em>Polynesia</em> and <em>pre-Columbian Mexico</em>, also consumed dog meat in their history. Dog fat is also reportedly believed to be beneficial for the lungs in some parts of Poland and Central Asia. Proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is Western hypocrisy and that there is no difference in eating different animals' meat.
			</p>

			<p>
				In Korea, the primary dog breed raised for meat, the <em>Nureongi</em>, differs from those breeds raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their homes.
			</p>

			<p>
				The most popular Korean dog dish is called <em>bosintang</em>, a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months. Followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's <em>gi</em>, or the body's vital energy. A 19th-century version of bosintang explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with <em>scallions</em> and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots. While the dishes are still prevalent in Korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, pork and chicken.

			<h3>Health risks</h3>
			<p>
				In 2018, the <em>WHO</em> reported that 59,000 people died globally from <em>rabies</em>, with 59.6% in Asia and 36.4% in Africa. Rabies is a disease for which dogs are the most important vector. Significant dog bites affect tens of millions of people globally each year. Children in mid-to-late childhood are the largest percentage bitten by dogs, with a greater risk of injury to the head and neck. They are more likely to need medical treatment and have the highest death rate. Sharp claws with powerful muscles behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that can lead to serious infections.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the <em>U.S., cats</em> and dogs are a factor in more than 86,000 falls each year. It has been estimated that around 2% of dog-related injuries treated in U.K. hospitals are domestic accidents. The same study found that while dog involvement in road traffic accidents was difficult to quantify, dog-associated road accidents involving injury more commonly involved two-wheeled vehicles.
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>Toxocara canis</em> (dog <em>roundworm</em>) eggs in dog feces can cause <em>toxocariasis</em>. In the United States, about 10,000 cases of Toxocara infection are reported in humans each year, and almost 14% of the U.S. population is infected. Untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision. Dog feces can also contain <em>hookworms</em> that cause <em>cutaneous larva migrans</em> in humans.

				<p>
					Dogs suffer from the same common disorders as humans; these include cancer, diabetes, heart disease and neurologic disorders. Their pathology is similar to humans, as is their response to treatment and their outcomes. Researchers are identifying the genes associated with dog diseases similar to human disorders, but lack mouse models to find cures for both dogs and humans. The genes involved in canine obsessive-compulsive disorders led to the detection of four genes in humans' related pathways.
				</p>

				<p>
					The scientific evidence is mixed as to whether a dog's companionship can enhance human physical health and psychological well-being. Studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological well-being have been criticized for being poorly controlled. It found that "the health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal." Earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not, making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than non-guardians.

					A 2005 paper states "recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. Research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets." In one study, new guardians reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition. This effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the study.
				</p>

				<p>
					People with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets. The results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behavior and that for guardians of dogs, these effects are relatively long-term. Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival. Human guardians are significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs. The association between dog ownership and adult physical activity levels has been reviewed by several authors.
				</p>

				<p>
					The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in a pet dog's presence, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral and psychological indicators of anxiety. Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases according to the <em>hygiene hypothesis</em>. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs cannot only provide companionship and social support themselves but also act as facilitators of social interactions between humans. One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when accompanied by a dog than when they are not. In 2015, a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners.
				</p>

				<p>
					Using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late 18th century, when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders. Animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase social behaviors, such as smiling and laughing, among people with Alzheimer's disease. One study demonstrated that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, increased knowledge and skill objectives and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared with those not in an animal-assisted program.

					Dogs were depicted to symbolize <em>guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, alertness</em>, and <em>love</em>. In ancient <em>Mesopotamia</em>, from the <em>Old Babylonian period</em> until the <em>Neo-Babylonian</em>, dogs were the symbol of <em>Ninisina</em>, the goddess of healing and medicine, and her worshippers frequently dedicated small models of seated dogs to her. In the <em>Neo-Assyrian</em> and Neo-Babylonian periods, dogs were used as emblems of magical protection. In <em>China, Korea</em> and <em>Japan</em>, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.

					In mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as watchdogs. Stories of dogs guarding the gates of the underworld recur throughout Indo-European mythologies and may originate from <em>Proto-Indo-European religion</em>. In <em>Greek mythology, Cerberus</em> is a three-headed, <em>dragon</em>-tailed watchdog who guards the gates of <em>Hades</em>. Dogs are also associated with the Greek goddess <em>Hecate</em>. In <em>Norse mythology</em>, a bloody, four-eyed dog called <em>Garmr</em> guards <em>Helheim</em>. In <em>Persian mythology</em>, two four-eyed dogs guard the <em>Chinvat Bridge</em>. In <em>Welsh mythology, Annwn</em> is guarded by <em>Cŵn Annwn</em>. In <em>Hindu mythology, Yama</em>, the god of death, owns two watchdogs who have four eyes. They are said to watch over the gates of <em>Naraka</em>. A black dog is also considered to be the <em>vahana</em> (vehicle) of <em>Bhairava</em> (an incarnation of Shiva).
				</p>

				<p>
					In <em>Christianity</em>, dogs represent faithfulness. Within the <em>Roman Catholic</em> denomination specifically, the iconography of <em>Saint Dominic</em> includes a dog, after the saint's mother dreamt of a dog springing from her womb and becoming pregnant shortly after that. As such, the <em>Dominican Order</em> (<em>Ecclesiastical Latin</em>: Domini canis) means "dog of the Lord" or "hound of the Lord" (Ecclesiastical Latin: Domini canis). In Christian folklore, a <em>church grim</em> often takes the form of a black dog to guard Christian churches and their <em>churchyards</em> from <em>sacrilege</em>. <em>Jewish law</em> does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets. Jewish law requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them.[citation needed] The view on dogs in <em>Islam</em> is mixed, with some schools of thought viewing it as unclean, although <em>Khaled Abou El Fadl</em> states that this view is based on "pre-Islamic Arab mythology" and "a tradition to be falsely attributed to the Prophet." Therefore, Sunni Malaki and Hanafi jurists permit the trade of and keeping of dogs as pets.
